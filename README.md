# Design

Squad Maker is designed to find an adequate solution to the problem: given N users with three different attributes, fit them into bins M so that all three different attributes are as balanced as possible, and all bins contain equal number of users.

Squad Maker is designed with the following input limitations:

- The input number of squads must be greater than 1 (squads will be pitted against each other so no need for 1 supergroup) and less than or equal to the number of players.
